A little description on the assignment :

    I have created a shell which is cabable of handling some particular commands.My main file is main.c which is used to call executable of other c programs of differernt commands.
    I have created a Makefile to compile all of them and run the shell.For the commands they can be executed in two different ways


    1.by using fork() and exec() family
    2.by using pthread_create() and system() command




Following are the internal commands handled by the shell:-

1.pwd (pwd -L, pwd -P)
2.cd
3.echo(echo -n ,echo -E)

Following are the external commands handled by the shell(both by threads and fork-exec usage):-

1.ls,ls -l,ls -a
2.date,date +%y,date +%B
3.mkdir,mkdir -v,mkdir -p
4.rm, rm -i, rm -f
5.cat, cat -A, cat -b

Types of  error handled by the system

1.wrong commands error
2.fork error
3.wrong option error(printed by the system if we give wrong option as argument)
